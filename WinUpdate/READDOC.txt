The win_updates module is used to either check for or to install Windows Updates. The module utilizes the built in Windows Update service to function. This means that you still will need a backend system like WSUS or the online Windows Update Servers to download updates from. If your server’s Windows Update configuration is set to automatically download but not install, you can also utilize the module to stage updates by telling it to search for updates. We also have the ability to whitelist or blacklist updates. For example we could tell it to only install one particular security update instead of every update available.
